title: In Search of Product Market Fit after YC's Startup School
---

A couple of months ago I join [YC's Startup
School](https://www.startupschool.org/) where I started developing the MVP for
[ArtsySpace](www.artsyspace.net), an online community of people that enjoy
decorating their homes. When I joined startup school I had only an idea for what
I wanted to be a side project. There were group session, where you get to pitch
your idea to other founders which was a really helpful way to get feedback and
put your ideas to test.

During Startup School, there was a lesson by [Michael Seibel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hHMwLxN6EM&feature=emb_title)
where he is going over a slide that states *Some understanding of the problem is very helpful when
building an MVP so plese talk to your users before  writing code.* After that
lesson I reached out to anyone I saw as a potential user to talk to them and
also remove many features I wanted to add to the MVP. I felt good with the
problem research phase and started developing the MVP for ArtsySpace.

There were many technical problems, but for the MVP I just wanted to release
fast to see if there was an interest. So after about of month of building the
MVP of [ArtsySpace](www.artsyspace.net) during my free time I decided to release
it. So I went and posted on Indie Hackers, Reddit and LinkedIn. I thought that
if the product was at least somewhat interesting people will sign up or post.

I was pretty excited when I checked Google Analytics to see that I was getting
some views on [ArtsySpace](www.artsyspace.net).

So Google Analytics was showing visits from users after posting on online
forums. Not only that I was getting users from France to Russia which was
awesome to see.

But my hype didn't last long and I then realized that althought I was getting
visitors people weren't signing up. But I was being naive to think that users
will just come and sign up. So I shared it in decoration forums and still I
wasn't getting users to sign up. So I wrote a
post on Indie Hackers asking: [I have spent 2 weeks trying to find market fit should I quit?](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/i-have-spent-2-weeks-trying-to-find-market-fit-should-i-quit-a32f2738c8), where even the founder of IH [Courtland
Allen](https://twitter.com/csallen?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)
commented.

Based, on the feedback I realised theres a long way to go. I was being naive
thinking that product market fit would just come around the block once I
launched. So now I'm in the search of how to improve my side project with the
best approach I have come to appreciate `talk with users`. Maybe this side
project doesn't grow, maybe it will but what a great learning experience this has been.
